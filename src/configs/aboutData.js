" minting out and each piece would be a 1 of 1. We used cardinal's private Gans to generate a curation of spectacular art.","In our process we looked to artists like Helen Frankenthaler, Mary Cassatt, and Liron Yanconsky; to act as the baseline of what systems produce. While we looked at these artists for inspiration the actual flowers themselves just like nature will be random and unpredictable. Whether it looks like Rafflesia Arnoldii (voted world ugliest flower) or a common rose/lily each one has a unique appearance and value all its own.","These decaying flowers will symbolize the temporary treasures we hold as we share these community moments."]
