The plan is to be able to order duplicates in the future (duplicates of these prints will be available but only with proof of tokenized ownership) after the initial rollout of prints. Ensuring access to your physical prints for years to come. We know the point of nfts is to be easily transferable and always accessible to the purchaser, but are hoping that this will allow us to meld the world of abstract and impressionist art with ntfs. "
